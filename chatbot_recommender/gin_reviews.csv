journeyman bilberry black hearts gin,"Back Label: According to Thomas Hardy’s novel, The Return of the Native, the bilberries were called, “black-hearts.” Everyone has a bit of a dark heart, but there’s always a sweet return at the smell and taste of familiar things. Distiller Comments: Indigenous to Britain and northern Europe, the bilberry takes center stage next to a supporting cast of juniper and seven other botanicals in our gin. A cousin to the huckleberry and blueberry, the bilberry is smaller with a fuller taste and is extremely hard to grow. Thus it is seldom cultivated. The fruit is mostly collected from wild plants growing on public lands. It is an everyman’s right to collect bilberries irrespective of land ownership. The bilberry is dark in color and usually appears black, thus the berry was commonly referred to as a black heart in 19th century southwestern England. I hope that this truly unique berry and its flavors of tart fig, pepper, and black licorice rest well on your pallet. Product Information: Juniper, bilberries and seven other botanicals are macerated and soaked in a 100% organic wheat base spirit overnight. The next day the base spirit, by now full of flavor from the botanicals, enters the still and is distilled into a refined gin. The definition of small batch, each gin run produces less than ten gallons of distillate. Bilberry Black Hearts Gin is clean, bright, and fruity with subtle hints of black licorice.","This Bilberry Black Hearts Gin is aptly named after the famed Bilberry, cousin to the huckleberry & blueberry."

bootlegger 21 new york gin,"We were inspired by the classic London dry gins that use a maceration process and a simple botanical blend. Our goal was to have a Juniper forward gin and pull complementary floral, earthy and citrus notes from the Coriander seeds, Lemon Verbena leaves, Orris Root, also known as Iris root, and bitter orange peels. We steep our botanicals in 120 proof neutral spirit made from 100% Corn for 24 hours to produce our maceration. We then distill the gin in our 300 gallon pot still to remove all of the color and bind the flavors. The “Hearts” are captured and blended down to 94 proof for bottling.

bummer and lazarus dry gin,"Bummer and Lazarus were two stray dogs that lived in San Francisco in the mid 1800s. Bummer rescued Lazarus from a fight, and from that point on they never separated. Most of the time back then, strays were killed on sight because dogs outnumbered humans 2 to 1, but Bummer and Lazarus were so loved that there was a separate statute allowing the dogs not only to roam the city, but downtown San Francisco where NO dogs were ever allowed. The reason for this was these were the best ‘ratters’ in the city. When Lazarus died over 30,000 people attended the funeral and when Bummer died Mark Twain wrote the eulogy. Mark Twain actually used the dogs in some of his stories. Bummer and Lazarus gin starts as brandy made from 100% California grapes then is redistilled with juniper berries, orris root, coriander seed, angelica root, bitter orange peel, lemon peel, cinnamon bark and licorice root.","Named in honor of two stray dogs that captivated the city of San Francisco, this gin is distilled from 100% California grapes."
citadelle reserve 2013 gin,"Nearly every gin sold on the market today is bottled immediately after distilling, but Citadelle Réserve Vintage sleeps for several months in small, seasoned French oak barrels before being bottled. While this is very unusual today, this painstaking and lengthy practice is reminiscent of how gin was stored and transported more than 100 years ago when glass (too fragile and expensive), plastic and stainless steel were not options. Gabriel’s experimentation began in 2008 when he put his Citadelle Gin into a few old French oak casks – and voilà, Citadelle Gin Réserve was born and became the first barrel-aged Citadelle gin. It was a very rounded gin with notes of wood and vanilla while still being very juniper forward. It was such a new and unique gin that it sold out within weeks of its global introduction! Upon tasting Citadelle Réserve 2008, the Spanish press called Gabriel the “master of spirits.”","Matured in three unique types of casks, this is the world's first solera aged gin."

Ed agreed without hesitation, before realizing he could do a whole lot better. Rather than just donate a few bottles of the gin he had on hand, Ed turned back to his copper pot still and got to work on an entirely new gin that would serve as a tribute to the injured troops. When he had finished, he was left with a case of twelve bottles of new gin: Comb Jarhead Gin, named as a nod to the Marines, with whom he so proudly served.","Distilled from New York state wheat and honey, a portion of the sales from this gin will be donated to the Wounded Warrior Project."
